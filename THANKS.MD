# THANKS

A heartfelt thank-you to the projects and communities whose work powers this Map Generator:

- [FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite) – the versatile noise library underpinning our procedural previews.
- [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com) – supplying the iconography that keeps the UI expressive.
- [Webix](https://webix.com) – the UI framework that makes our complex SPA layout possible.

We appreciate the maintainers and contributors who share these tools with the community.
